## Running instructions
* Copy project to your directory ( `git clone https://github.com/ibnzUK/Token-Staking-dApp` )
* Install project packages (`npm install`)
* Start project (`npm run start`)

## For Testing
* To run tests, navigate to /test/TokenStaking and run: `truffle test`
 
## For Admin Use
* There are prewritten scripts for Admin use either manually or on daily, weekly basic, ideally with predefined cronjob from the server.
* All scripts are located in `/scripts` folder
* To change APY % run: ```truffle exec scripts/changeAPY.js 0.137``` this script takes 1 argument (daily APY),  in this provided example, admin sets `0.137` daily APY

* To redistribute rewards from the console, run: ```truffle exec scripts/redistribute.js``` or provide argument `custom` if you want to redistribute custom rewards

## Deployoment to Ethereum network and Verification

For private Ethereum test network make sure Ganache is running on HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545
* First configure `truffle-config.js` with your infura key and mnemonic key. You can reate files in top dirrectory under names `.infuraKey` and `.secret` and paste your keys in there
* If you planning to publish your project on github make sure you `.gitignore` your keys 
* Compile smart contracts with `truffle compile`
* Deploy to your local (Ganache) network run: `truffle migrate --reset ` or for Ethereum test network (Rinkeby) run: `truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset` or change `rinkeby` to `ropsten`
* To verify contract code on Ethereum test network add your Etherscan API key to `.ethKey` and for (Rinkeby) run: `truffle run verify TestToken --network rinkeby` or change `rinkeby` to `ropsten`
